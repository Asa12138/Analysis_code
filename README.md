## 1. GRSA_figures

Inspired by the classic ‘RSA’, we developed the improved ‘Generalized Reporter Score-based Analysis (GRSA)’ method, implemented in the R package ‘ReporterScore’, along with comprehensive visualization methods and pathway databases.

‘GRSA’ is a threshold-free method that works well with all types of biomedical features, such as genes, chemical compounds, and microbial species. Importantly, the ‘GRSA’ supports multi-group and longitudinal experimental designs, because of the included multi-group-compatible statistical methods.
